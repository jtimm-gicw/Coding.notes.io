# **Command line**

A **command line**, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

Here are some of the most commonly used Git commands in the terminal, grouped by purpose:
1. *Basic Setup*

git add .

9. *Deleting Branches*
